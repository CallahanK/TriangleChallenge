# TriangleChallenge
Spring 2015 - Java

Program reads in series of integers as shown below from a text file. The data is then placed into a graph-type data structure and a recursive algorithm is used to find the maximum total from top to bottom.


    Example:
      By starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below,
      the maximum total from top to bottom is 27.
              5
            9   6
          4   6   8
        0   7   1   5

      I.e. 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 = 27.
